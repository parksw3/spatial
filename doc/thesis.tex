\section{Introduction}

Modeling ecological data is challenging.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
S_{t+1} &= S_t + B_t - I_{t+1}\\
I_{t+1} &= \beta_t I_{t}^\alpha S_t/N_t
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{Susceptible reconstruction}

Recall that the susceptible population dynamics can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
S_{t+1} = S_{t} + B_t - I_{t+1}.
\end{equation}
Rewriting incidence as product of observed cases, $C_t$, divided by the reporting rate, $\rho_t$, we obtain the following:
\begin{equation}
S_{t+1} = S_t + B_t - \frac{C_t}{\rho_t}.
\end{equation}
Iteratively solving the equation yields the following relation:
\begin{equation}
S_{t+1} =  S_1 + \sum_{i=1}^t B_i - \sum_{i=1}^t \frac{C_i}{\rho_i}.
\label{eq:sus}
\end{equation}
Representing susceptible dynamics as a deviation from the mean number of susceptibles $S_t = \bar{S} + Z_t$, \cite{finkenstadt2000time} showed dynamics of $Z_t$ and $\rho_t$ can be recovered from the data by fitting a smooth curve to cumulative birth as a function of cumulative cumulative cases. 
\cite{dalziel2016persistent} then claimed that the result can be generalized by representing susceptible dynamics as a deviation from moving average, $S_t = \sigma N_t + W_t$, where $\sigma$ is proportion susceptible:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^t B_i = \sum_{i=1}^t \frac{C_i}{\rho_i} + W_{t+1} - W_1 + \sigma (N_{t+1} - N_1).
\label{eq:gensus}
\end{equation}
However, they did not provide sufficient theoretical justification; here, we analyze the claimed generalization.

\subsection*{Constant reporting rate}

First, consider the case when the reporting is contant ($\rho_i = \rho$ for all $\rho \in \mathbb{N}$), equation~\ref{eq:gensus} simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^t B_i = \frac{1}{\rho} \sum_{i=1}^t C_i + W_{t+1} - W_1 + \sigma (N_{t+1} - N_1).
\end{equation}
Writing $X_{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^t C_i$ and $Y_{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^t B_i$, we obtain a familiar form:
\begin{equation}
Y_{t+1} = \rho X_{t+1} + W_{t+1} - W_1 + \sigma (N_{t+1} - N_1).,
\end{equation}
which appears to suggest that linear regression can be used to estimate the reporting rate and susceptible dynamics \citep{finkenstadt2000time}.

When population size stays constant,
